<h2>Label and Identify Each Uploaded Image</h2>
<p>Have you ever tried to search for a photo on a messaging app but you are unsure which chat the photo appeared in? The Smart Chat Helper classifies and labels each uploaded image which allows easier searching in the future.</p>
<p>All you need to recall is the genearl context of the photo (i.e. it contains a ship, or a cat or a tree) and our smart app will be able to search and identify the photos for you.</p>

<h2>Summarizes Missed Chat Conversations</h2>
