    <p class="text-white py-4">Let's face it. This scenario has happened to all of us before. We have wasted time and effort to try and find a single photo among all our media content in every chat group and message that we have on our messaging app.
    <br><br>
    Or having to open all previously uploaded documents in a message thread in order to find the correct one.
    <br><br>
    Or having miss the gist of the messages between team mates for the day and having to scroll and read through the entire conversation thread just to make head or tail of what is happening.
