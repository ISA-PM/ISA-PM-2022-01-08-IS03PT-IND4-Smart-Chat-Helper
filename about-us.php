<h5>All of our team members have one common problem...<br>we lose track of our messages and conversations and their uploaded media content.</h5>
<br>
<h5>Most of the time, we waste a lot of time trying to find photos and documents that we have uploaded to our different chat groups.</h5>
<br>
<p>
And we are not unique in facing this problem. How many times have all of us tried to find a specific photo, knowing only general details like "it was a photo of a ship" or "it had cats in it" in our many different chat groups?
<br><br>
Or we tried to find an important document that was uploaded before but there was no way to search for the content of the document in our chat apps?
</p>
<p>
And so, the Smart Chat Helper application was born. Use our app to better manage our chat content
